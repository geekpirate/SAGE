"I’m a bit annoyed today if honest. The GI wrote on my letter that burping is often from swallowing too much air! I had 8 months of constant burping from 5pm each day until like 11pm when it would settle, sometimes 3am. Now it’s only the odd burp thank god so something is improving. But honestly I’m not swallowing air and it annoys me. If I’m doing it psychologically why would I not do it some days LOL you wait until long Covid is more recognised there will be tons of cases of extreme burping. Frustrated.

"Frustrated.... I got it in July, followed by 3 months of serratia marcescens pneumonia, that i got at the hospital. I have had CT of my lungs showing minor scarring and calcification on my heart. Wth the continued SOB, nasty heart palpitations, and my BP ranging from 115/75 (my normal, and now only achieved before getting out of bed at the crack of dawn) to 165/105 when I did a telemed call with my pulmonologist today. She had me do an echocardiogram and that came back normal. I was hoping I be the exception to the long hauler curse of nothimg on the tests, but nope, no luck. I'm still out of work because these symptoms are constant, with no answers. I know when i saw my primary 2 months ago, the hope was that i would be ready to return to work. I see him for a follow up on Monday. This is all just absolutely crazy. The pulmonologist today ordered another round of prednisone because. Ive been off of it for ablut 10 days and my cough is back and producing crap again. I get to do another suptum culture in the next week again. If i have something weird again, I am going to go nuts.

"Hi!  I don’t really talk about this, I’ve mostly kept it in, so I could stay positive about it, but it’s time to share and let it out.  I don’t really know where to begin other than to say next month will be one year for me, and I think since I’m coming up on the one year anniversary of when this all started, it’s bringing up some emotion because I never would’ve imagined I’d still be fighting this for this long.  I know there are many of you who are probably feeling the same way.  Even though my family understands, no one really gets it like you guys.  We are the only ones who know just how bad it feels inside to have our lives turned upside down. Before this, I was very active.  I loved hiking, kayaking, traveling, exploring, swimming, snorkeling, jogging and just being out in nature.  I live a very healthy lifestyle, so this threw me for a loop. Since the beginning I’ve had chest pain with any activity.  I have seen signs of improvement which is really encouraging, but I always end up going back downhill.  Yesterday, I was able to organize a few cabinets.  It was the first time in almost a year that I could do something like that, so it was a big deal and I was pretty excited about it.  Later, I paid for it but it was worth it lol. I’ve had seven family members who have caught the virus and recovered.  Some had more severe symptoms than others, but they’re all better now.  Watching everyone around me recover is bittersweet.  I’m genuinely happy for their recovery but at the same time asking, when will I get over this?  My concern is, what if this doesn’t get better?  No one really knows yet how long this could go on, or what damage may have been done.  I gave up on doctors in the beginning after being treated poorly and having no answers.  One nurse who knew nothing about me said I’ve “conditioned myself to the couch” and that I needed to exercise.  I was in shock.  After somehow getting the courage up to see another doctor, I was referred to another cardiologist, but I just decided to take care of myself the best I could at home.  I would’ve thought by now I’d be better.  Is anyone else having chest pain that’s gone on this long?  Has anyone gotten any answers about this? I’ve been able to maintain a positive attitude through this whole thing and keep my focus on the good, and I think that is what’s getting me through this.  I just had to get this off my chest. (No pun intended ) Take care everyone!  Sorry this ended up being so long!

"Sort of related, and I’d really appreciate your prayers and good vibes...Some really close friends of mine, those friends that are family, are going through something heartbreaking.  Last year, they got pregnant with their first children, twins after a long struggle.  At 22 weeks, suddenly mom went into labor.  Isla lived for 5 weeks and Finn fought for 8, but ultimately they both passed.They told all of us just a month ago, they were pregnant again, this time with one baby.  Unfortunately, during the most recent check-up they found a mass on mom’s liver.  On Christmas Eve they found out it was indeed cancer.  She had surgery Wednesday to cut off blood flow to the tumor and inject chemo directly there, the safest option for now.  The surgery went well.  She was all set to go home yesterday.  Shortly before release, she went to the restroom, and almost exactly in the same way she went into labor with the twins- the same happened again.  This time she is only 15.5 weeks along, there was no way of saving the baby.  At 9:30 last night my precious niece was born, and went on to heaven.  She is now with her brother and sister.I am heartbroken for them.  Because of my this stress and all my covid complications (I had covid in July and have been hit hard neurologically) I am exhausted.  As you guys know all to well, this makes all the things worse. I am supposed to be getting my house ready to go on the market, since I can’t live here anymore now that I am in a wheelchair.   I am supposed to go to PT/OT today, and I can’t, I can’t even transfer back and forth from my chair. This has just derailed all the things.Anyhow, thoughts/prayers whatever you believe for all of us would be appreciated.

"So I’ve been waiting a few weeks to post this so here it is. I had COVID back at the end of July and was hospitalized for 8 days with COVID pneumonia. When I finally got home the side effects were just as worse as the pneumonia. For me it was the brain fog, extreme fatigue, and the virus affected my legs to the point where they were numb, tingley, and ached. I couldn’t hardly walk up stairs. Almost like I had no control over them. Side note...this is from going to the gym 3 days a week before COVID hit...so I was in good shape prior. Fast forward to the day before Christmas. I’m switching PCP’s and saw him on Dec 24th. He suggested I receive a flu shot and because I am 50 a shingles shot. So I did. Christmas Day I woke up with a fever and aches from the flu shot I’m assuming. I spent the day generally not feeling good. On Dec 26th I woke up and started going about business as usual. As the morning progressed I suddenly noticed that my legs didn’t hurt, the numbness was gone, I felt like I had control over them again! The brain fog was gone. For the first time in 5 months I felt good! I contacted my new doctor and he said that it may have been the flu shot that distracted my immune system from fighting against my body. I don’t know what it was but I know this I can play sports again and I still after 2 weeks feel great! I thank the Lord for the relief and science for working for me! LOL I hope all those still suffering will find their relief of body soon. Remember too that only Jesus can give us the relief of our spirit. Praying for all those who feel “stuck”! Maybe today will your day! Press on! Don’t let this virus stop you! Don’t let it rob you of your joy!

"Christmas Day I had a horrible pain in the area of my left shoulder blade on the side toward my spine. My neck was still too. Next my shoulder and arm became so painful I could t function. I thought I must have pulled a muscle. A day after that, the fingers and thumb on my left hand went partially numb. I thought it would go away after a few days because I thought it was due to a muscle strain or maybe a pinched nerve. Well it’s been well over a week now and the pain comes and goes depending upon the position I’m in but the numbness has only gotten worse. I described it to my children as the feeling you get when you accidentally get super glue on the tip of your fingers. Apparently I must be the only one who’s ever done this because they looked at me like I was crazy. But whenever I’ve done that I couldn’t feel what I touched with the tip of my fingers because of the glue. Now I can’t even hold things with that hand. Despite my fear of getting Cove it again my therapist talked me into going to the chiropractor to at least get x-rays and see if I have a pinched nerve or some thing. Is there anyway that any of this could be related to Covid?￼￼￼

Is anybody else in a similar position at 6+ months?The good news is she took me seriously when I stated plainly ""all of those together are what is keeping me out of the ER right now, but this is not what I would consider 'well-controlled'"". She also understood what I meant when I told her I can't get a cardiologist consult because 1. They're super busy and 2. I'm outpatient only, which makes me low priority now that it's been an outstanding issue for over 6 months. She is now ordering a cardiologist consult for me through her office because she can see something isn't right, but it's going to take someone who knows more about the heart than she does. She's also referring me to an allergist to see if injections used for asthma might help me based on my eosinophils and calling in a prednisone script to have on hand in case I have a flare while she's super busy.

"I’ve had two appointments this week.  Monday with my rheumatologist and today with my pulmonologist.   I’m 6 mos. post Covid today.  My CT scan showed improvement from August to October.  Unfortunately, from October to December there has not been any improvement.  What that means in a nutshell is that any improvement from Covid is probably complete and the resulting lung damage is permanent and potentially progressive.  My pulmonologist referred me to a cardiologist for a right side heart cath as she strongly suspects I have pulmonary hypertension.  My rheumatologist had added a new medication (sulfasalazine) to treat the underlying rheumatoid conditions that have contributed to the lung issues but my pulmonologist does not feel he’s being aggressive enough and has suggested a few other options so I’ll be discussing those with my rheumatologist.  My head is kind of swimming with all this information right now.    Feeling very overwhelmed. Not sure what it means in terms of going back to work.  My PCP had set forth criteria for me to be able to return.  One of which was to be completely off all oxygen.  That’s not going to happen.  I no longer require it 24/7 but still have to use it for activity (walking, exercise, house work, etc) and likely always will.  I was a RN providing direct patient care when I got Covid.  So those days are over.    Ugh!!

I am still experiencing these things but with gradually lessening intensity.  I highly recommend seeing a psychiatrist, who can also help you deal with the natural anxiety and depression that comes with Long-Covid.  I am on one antidepressant that deals with anxiety and body pain and another that deals with depression and gives an energy boost and I've also been given something to help me sleep, high-dose Vit D, C,Zinc, Vit B injections, strong probiotic.  Stay strong and don't feel pill shamed!

It is love, anger, success? At the end of the day it is HOPE!What is it to hope?Hope is there when you break your ankle and you are told it is not repairable...Hope is there when you lose your child and don't know how you will even face another day...Hope is there when you get a diagnosis of COVID and you are suffocating...Hope is there when your kids are sick...Hope is there when you are chronically ill...Hope is there when you are told your prognosis isn't good...Hope is there when you get fired from your job...Hope is there when you fail your classes...Hope is there when your pain seems never ending...Hope is there when you get a promotion...Hope is there when your doctor listens to you and starts running a battery of tests to figure you out...Hope is there when you meet 11,000 strangers that all understand what you are going through...Hope is there when you find out you are pregnant...Hope is there when you get engaged...Hope is there when you graduate...Hope is there when you have your first kiss...Hope is there when you fall in love...Nothing in life is ever accomplished without HOPE! You ask what my motivation is that keeps pushing me forward through hurdle after hurdle and hardship after hardship? Hope is my motivation! Even when things seem hopeless! You may not be able to count on people or things but you can count on hope, you just have to believe in it! Hope is like the Santa Claus of life! There is no magic in it if you don't believe! Religious people of all sorts hold onto their faith in times of hardship and celebration because it gives them hope! Hope is the backbone that keeps us propelling forward with or without religion! As long as their is breath left in us (even just a little bit for some of us) There is still hope!We are all robbed of it at times and we are all gifted it at others. Today I got a bit of that back and I don't know how long it will last but man did it feel good when it happened!I started my journey into physical therapy after months and months of trying to get the appointment and the referral orders situated. I now know the reason it took so long. I have a physical therapist that just recently moved here that has been working for months with post covid/ long covid patients! I will be watching hours of videos about the science of the therapy I will be receiving (not because I have to but because my Physical therapist recognized that for me to heal and trust after all I have been through I need to be able to educate myself on all the WHYS! She told me to revisit the SPOON THEORY (if you have never researched this you should especially if you have anyone close to you dealing with chronic illness, I will try to attach a link to this post to info on the spoon theory) She reminded me that I need to remind my friends and family of my limitations and that I need to stay strong in boundaries I need to create for myself if I am going to heal, but also I need to be kind to myself and take it easy to conserve energy. Not out of laziness but out of necessity to be able to enjoy some semblance of quality of life. This includes learning and practicing energy conservation by using assisted devices such as a cane, oxygen, electric powered shopping carts, shower stools, shoe horns, etc.. By using these strategies, it may help me to have that little bit of energy to enjoy my kids or fiancé rather then using up all my energy doing simple things that most people take for granted! It is humbling how much we all take for granted when you suddenly realize how much effort these things can really be.Each of these things can be counted as a number of spoons... You start each day with only so many spoons. Each task you have to give up 1 or more of those spoons in exchange for the energy it is equal to. If you spend all of your spoons on showering (say 1 for showering while sitting and 2 or 3 if you shower standing up) you have no spoons left to spend on doing simple things you actually enjoy or even other things you just have to tend to, like spending time with loved ones, or even working!My physical therapist let me know that in time she feels confident that I will get much better. The beginning will likely be the most difficult as we navigate through trying to determine how much activity and what type is appropriate as there is no science to an individual and all therapy needs to be tapered to the patients needs. Since COVID is still new, therapies I receive and many others will be documented and studied to help create programs for others like myself. For that I am grateful to know what I am suffering through may be able to help someone else not have to suffer so much.When asked what my goal for therapy was I answered ""To live again"". I've never been more serious. In order to do that I need to regain strength, stamina, and endurance. Nothing about this will be easy but in the end hopefully it will be worth it.I ask that you do not offer me advice on how to best push through as I have overcome so many obstacles in my life to date that I have always been able to push through, this is not like other obstacles I can assure you. The best gift you can give me is by support. Listening to understand, rather then to respond. Bringing me vegetables, fruit, and supplements, rather then McDonalds. Surprising me with a blinged out cane, a basket filled with vitamins, or a pretty medical alert bracelet and a great pair of compression stockings. Don't just tell me how strong I am but validate how difficult it is and how much I continue to go through. Be there for support for my kids and realize how much this must be for them, as they are forced to grow up much too soon and taking care of me as much as I take care of them (They need and deserve patience and understanding too)! Be patient when I flake out and don't respond or my responses are short. Again... spoons and brain fog.I start full force in about a week or 2. I'm nervous about setbacks and excited to see results and gains. I may likely never be 100% again and that is something I may have to accept some day, but today is not that day because today I have hope!What is Spoon Theory?HEALTHLINE.COMWhat is Spoon Theory?Understand life with chronic illness in a way that's never been explained before.HEALTHLINE.COMWhat is Spoon Theory?Understand life with chronic illness in a way that's never been explained before.Hope/Uplifting

"Managed to get COVID twice last year, once in March before everyone really knew what was going on, and then once again before Christmas. This last time I didn't feel quite as sick as I did back in March, didn't get a fever, didn't have GI symptoms, didn't get the serious fatigue or any congestion or any other cold-like symptoms, but my respiratory symptoms were worse this time around.I'm now 2 weeks out from the quarantine period and 3 1/2 weeks out from the last time I experienced any real symptoms but I am still having chest pain and trouble breathing. Sometimes it is a struggle to take a deep breath, and when I do it hurts, from all the way up below my shoulders to down at the bottom of my ribs. Sometimes the ache lasts all day. My resting heart rate is also much higher than average, where I'm normally sitting below 70, I'm closer to 80. I've never had any cardiac problems before. The last trip I had to the doctor, I was on the higher side of normal for my BP, and I'm usually on the lower side. I also get very serious sinus pressure and pain throughout the day that doesn't respond to medication. My cheeks just hurt so bad.Do these sound like long-hauler symptoms? I'm not even sure I should go to the doctor for any of this -- what would they even do for me?

"Hello,I am writing this to you all because I can’t help but feel very alone in my continued symptoms. I feel like I am at a point of desperation/exhaustion that I didn’t know even existed. I wanted to share my story and see if anyone has had a similar experience.I am 32 years old. I have a 4 year old, 2 year old and one on the way. Due in may. I am (or was) an active avid outdoorsman and healthy individual before I got sick on April 10th.Here is my timelineApril 10th - Out on a walk with my family and felt like I was going to pass out. All of the symptoms then hit me. Heart racing, light headed, short of breath (sensation of not being able to get full breath) extreme weakness and fatigue. I would be sitting on the couch and my heart rate would go up to 155. Anything I did would exhaust me. I spent weeks in bed. Due to the lack of testing at the time, I was unable to get a covid test because I was not considered high risk. This went on till end of may and then lessened.June 15 - Everything came back with a vengeance. Worst symptom at the time was Tachycardia. Thought I was having a heart attack. Went to ER. Tested for covid this time (negative) They did chest X-ray and everything looked good. Received a referral for cardiology.1 week later my wife loses her sense of smell, tests positive for covid. (Only symptom for her was loss of smell, her and baby are good. Fully recovered) I go to see a cardiologist, proceeded to have an Echo, Stress Test and wore a monitor for 2 weeks. All tests came back normal They were able to see my heart rate increases and my palpitations I was feeling. The doc said, “we can see it happening, we don’t know why” he also said there is nothing physically wrong with my heart. All the while I am in bed every single day and the tachycardia is only 1 symptoms of many. The other debilitating symptom that came out of nowhere is TMJ. I had horrible Jaw pain that ends up giving me daily migraines. This all continued till Oct 25th.Oct 25th - Dec 29th = healthy. I was feeling myselfDecember 29th - current....feeling very weak, nausea, TMJ, dizziness, Chills, I feel like I have a fever but I don’t.... I have now been in bed since the 29th. Unable to help my pregnant wife with our kids. It has become very emotional for me every morning I wake up and try to get going, only to have the symptoms hit me soon after getting out of bed. One thing that seems to be especially weird is that my symptoms are bad all day and seem to lessen in the evening and night time.Has anyone else experienced feeling better for months and then have it all come back?Has anyone else gone through all of this and never received a positive covid test? I even gave blood to check for antibodies and that came back negative. This has to be covid right? It’s really scary to literally have no answers, no end in sight. Feeling helpless  sorry for the long post/sob storyFrustrated

"Going on 6 months. Just tested negative for antibodies. I’m terrified. I know some of you have braved it twice.  I’m in Southern California where the virus is extremely prevalent. My husband works in a clinic in LA.  I feel like it’s only a matter of time. Have many of you managed to not get it a second time?COVID just sucks. That is all.

"Hello my fellow long haulers!This is my first time posting here.This is a long post, but I hope you’ll take the time and share some of your wisdom with me and others that have been going through the same.I had Covid in the beginning of March, however I was never confirmed due to the lack of testing. In July my husband and my 4 year old tested positiv for antibodies, myself and my 3 year old didn’t. I was the sickest of them all. My worst issues were not being able to take a deep breath and constantly feeling like my heart is going to explode. My oxygen levels were always fine. I went to the hospital at the end of March and all test came back fine. I had a slight QT Prolongation of the heart which after being on a heart monitor for a week completely disappeared. By mid May I started feeling better. But about a month or so later the breathing issues started to come back. And little by little so many other problems. I’ve been feeling tired all the way since March no matter how much I sleep. Severe nausea and the feeling of being hungover for weeks. Neuropathy in legs, arms and hands. Pressure in the chest. Heart racing. Strange vascular issues in my legs, almost feeling like isolated pain in my veins. But the main thing that seems to not go away fully is the not being able to take a deep breath. Constantly gasping for air. I have a few weeks I’m good and then it starts up again for a week or two. Then it goes away and comes back again. It feels like a never ending cycle. It’s been 10 months now. Has anyone had similar issues and found a doctor that was able to help or any advise you could share I would really appreciate it.Praying for you all and hope we will be able to defeat this horrible virus

I am BEGGING every single person I know to pray for Little Man. He got worse and I took him to the dr first thing this morning. The dr said he had to go DIRECTLY to the ER. They think he is having a side effect from Covid that attacks his organs. He is covered head to toe with a red rash and he is very bloated.  The dr said if I would not have brought him in this morning... I can’t even say it. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE pray he can recover and not have any long term organ damage. Please!!!! They said he has to be admitted and they won’t know if we caught it “in time “ until more tests are done. Doctors from infectious diseases are coming to this hospital to see him and run tests. He is the most joyful, most amazing little man who has had to fight to live even while in the womb!!! I NEED to know everyone who sees this will stop and pray for him. I can’t imagine what would have happened if we didn’t take him in and now I want to know he will be able to leave here absolutely whole and healthy!!  Please Lord help Dallas.

"Hi.I tested positive for COVID December 3. I ended up getting bilateral pneumonia and now am seeing a cardiologist because my heart rate has been insanely elevated. So far, all tests have come back normal, which is good news.But it’s also frustrating and I guess I just wanted to vent it to people I know will understand. I can’t walk further than 15’ without getting dizzy. A shower spikes my heart rate to 150 or more. I get short of breath with any movement. I’m exhausted all the time. My brain is so foggy, I forget the last names of family members and have to look them up on Facebook.I run a secured dementia unit and haven’t been able to return to work yet. Yesterday makes 5 weeks since I’ve been at work and I have no idea how in the world I can possibly go back to work - my job isn’t a desk job. I’m constantly running around, helping my team care for my residents and we are in medical-grade masks for full shifts.I am so frustrated. I have to work. My husband is so sweet and so understanding but the reality is that I’m the primary breadwinner in our household. I carry our medical insurance. My work is fighting allowing me to come back with any type of restrictions.I just feel like I’ve made so little healing progress. I know it’s slow for everyone and I know I had a severe case, but I just don’t feel better. I sit in bed the majority of my day.Ugh. Thank you for letting me whine.  I’m sorry any of us have to go through this.Heart

"Are you guys having issued with liver enzymes being high, getting non alcoholic liver disease, pain under your shoulder blade, side of ribcage and then around the front where people generally have gallbladder pains? Liver cysts too, but I did see that several people have had liver cysts post covid. I am trying to make a case with my dr that we really shouldn't dismiss all the above things because they are all issues that I've had since I got covid in march. The liver enzymes have been high multiple times since May when they checked them the first time after I got sick. Previously they've always been perfectly in range. I thought maybe if many of you have run into this, it would help me convince her that it's not just me being crazy.

"So, this is for all my LUNG haulers out their. In my 44 years of life, Covid pneumonia was my first pneumonia EVER. I had nothing to compare it to, like the normal pneumonia. Going on almost 7 months, and an olympic pool amount of prayer, more than one person told me, ""do lung excercises"". So, the other night, I youtube'd lung excercises, and the agreed on regimen was this. Sitting or standing, take a deep breath through nose, hold for 5 seconds, exhale calmly through mouth in a 'blowing out a candle's motion. Do this 5 times in a row, and on the 6th inhale, exhale with a huge COUGH. Do 2 series of these, and periodically do throughout the day. Also, and I find this helpful for me, give the back muscles a good stretch. Youtube back muscle stretches and use the info however you please. Since the lungs and back muscles are 'buddy, buddy', stretching does help. For you new long haulers reading this, start doing this therapy ASAP! Word of warning.......DO NOT STAY ON YOUR BACK. Stagnation gives pneumonia the upper hand. Keep breathing, keep exercising. Hope this helps yall. These days, as a long hauler, any relief is good relief.

"I was infected in May & hospitalized for 2 weeks in July. I tested neg in the local hospital's ER so they refused to treat me for or acknowledge that I still had COVID. I almost died. My fever spiked to 105.6 and they couldn't get the fever under control in the 5 days I was there. After being bedridden, I began to struggle to breath. My lungs were sticking together. Those closest to me helped me get out of that hospital. It wasn't easy. Drs. told me there was nothing that a Boston hospital was going to be able to do for me. I had acute respiratory failure, double pneumonia, which they said was all caused by some mysterious tick-borne illness. Then they told me that it may take days to be transferred to Boston. They told me they tried calling the hospital I wanted to go to but no-one was calling them back. Again and again they tried to convince me to stay. I didn't give up hope. I trusted my advocates would get me out bc I was in no condition to fight for myself. I was finally transferred at 3am, via ambulance, to Boston on day 6. I immediately was tested for COVID and it came back positive. I was given proper treatment and care and got better after a week. The original hospital immediately started billing me for my copays and my deductible. I appealed up the chain and was denied each time. I felt like the hospital wanted to stick it to me for leaving. I gave them my medical records from Boston. They refused to acknowledge I had COVID while I was in their care. I finally appealed to my insurer. After 6 months of fighting, I received my insurance appeal today. I won!. The insurance company agreed to cover all the bills in full. A huge weight has been lifted.

"This is the first time I’ve posted a topic here. I had my first symptom on September 27, 2020. I woke up with a headache. As the day progressed the worse I felt. By late afternoon, my body had started aching. October 1, 2020 I was diagnosed with Covid. I stayed home and fought the virus as long as I could. I monitored my O2 at home and my husband spoke with a family friend about my deteriorating condition often. My O2 dropped to 83% and by this time, I slept majority of the time. I had it set in my mind that I would die at my home. My husband took me to a local hospital because I couldn’t hold out to go any farther. I was quickly admitted into ICU. I stayed there over night and they transferred to a larger hospital which had more resources. There I was in the MICU and spent one night before being placed on a ventilator. I’m a 38 year older teacher. I thought my immune system would be able to fight off anything. I couldn’t be more wrong. Ive been discharged but have suffered other conditions due to Covid. I recently saw a neurologist and I’ve been dealing with memory loss and my speech is slurred. He did an MRI to rule out a stroke. Fortunately, I didn’t have a stroke but he still thinks I suffered a mini stroke. He told me today that he wants me to go on the medication, Aricept, among other meds. Has anyone started this medicine due to memory loss from Covid? I know Aricept is for Alzheimer’s patients. I’m just concerned starting this type of medication at such a young age.

He suggested I look to social media for solutions for treating my symptoms because we who are going through it know what works better than the medical community does right now.

"Hello again,I know I have previously complained about my pulmonary rehab but I’m still searching for new resources (I’m 21 year old heading into month 7 of symptoms). After attending for 4 weeks I have concluded that my rehab  is just monitored exercise. I’m not learning how to manage and combat my symptoms such as my SOB, chest pain, and fatigue. My program lacks a personal plan of care and doesn’t provide the educational workshop to reteach me proper breathing mechanics. My pulmonologist even called the program director to specifically ask them to go over breathing  mechanics with me, and they haven’t.I’m in WA state and I can’t seem to find one rehabilitation clinic or program specific to COVID-19 recovery.I know I’m not alone here. I just want personal care with a provider educated on COVID-19.

"I have a tip; when you start to feel that painful anxious or panic feeling, try rubbing aspercreme with lidocaine (be sure you get the one with the lidocaine) all over your chest. Why this works, I have no idea, but it gives me significant relief every time. Sometimes I have to reapply every 15-30 minutes until the painful anxiety or panic subsides, but it absolutely works wonders for me.

"Is it covid again? I went to the ER for fear of a blood clot six days ago exactly.  I read covid usually shows up five to six days after exposure . I have not been anywhere else, except grocery pickup. so today my fever has been between 99.5 (which happesn as a long hauler ) clear up to 100.3 at one point today (not a long hauler thing on me )   now im back to 99.5.  could this be covid? I dont want to get my son sick. I had it originally back in february with no test to prove it.    At the ER  a lady in the curtain next to me was coughing but i overheard she was there for a wound.   i wore a mask and was in the ER around 2 hours.  Thank you in advance.

"Even for a physician who is well-informed on COVID, do what I can to protect myself, etc, I have had times where I think I’ve gotten COVID again. I have certainly been very exposed at work, including high risk interventions. However, I remind myself that my symptoms are likely long COVID related mixed with the extra high level of stress at work. We are barely done surging and I’m already having to wrestle staff into using proper isolation measures, defend my decision to test people, etc. It is already back to how it was over the summer when our local prevalence was low. We are still seeing many COVID patients even if hospitals in the region are getting to decompress.I know the CDC revised its quarantine advisories for healthcare workers and that those changes were made based on the ju fee of workers with high risk exposures, not science. Just found out today that the PA and NP I work with both have had it and were told it was ok to return to work way before the quarantine for non-HCW was done. The PA is immunocompromised so should have a a total of 21 days of quarantine. While I’m glad he didn’t get seriously ill, I’ve gotten increased ectopic beats, a sore throat, aches, bad headaches, and some swollen lymph nodes. I’ve had more PACs/PVCs all along but it was daily. Now I’m getting them on and off all day when I’m at rest. I wanted to chalk it up to being vaccinated recently (for which I’m grateful), but my side effects were gone by the time I woke up for with the next day except a slight sore right deltoid.If the PA hadn’t told me about it, I would never have known. There wasn’t coverage for his shifts, so he was told to come back to work. So I basically worked for many shifts with known positive co-workers. I don’t blame them but am quite irritated at the hospital. Anyone can unfortunately/unwittingly expose others in the presymptomatic period or they remain asymptomatic. Then to have the hospital admin pull some other crap, remark that I asked for extra help twice during the worst of things (and I have not done that in 11-12 years of being an attending, though at the academic place I used to work at, the ER charge did activate the on-call doc to come in at times but wasn’t part of those decisions) and am used to working critical access ERs with high volume and acuity, to the point of being dangerous. I end up in chart purgatory and leaving 3-4 hours over a 12 hr shift. I tell myself that in the end, it’s about patient outcome, not being 15-20 charts behind. (This has mostly been a thing since the advent of EMRs; I can do paper charts or dictate like an auctioneer.)Right now though, I’m mostly frustrated. Throwing myself a pity party that has to end before I go back on duty tomorrow. Exhausted. And probably, with the sore throat, congestion, and rhinorrhea, etc, infected. I stay in my respirator on shift, I wear goggles when seeing patients. It’d be one thing to get it again from a patient, but when co-workers are being sent back while still high risk for shedding the virus. The icing on the cake today was duking it out with staff on non-COVID stuff related to patient care. I’m always happy to teach or explain; this was a bread and butter ER topic.Anyhow, I’m just emptying my brain for tonight. Every job will have difficult personalities and other cons. There is no such thing as a perfect group, facility, or job. I’m a flawed vessel too. I’m lucky in so many ways but I left work just fed up for the moment.

"I don’t know if I’m having a flare up of symptoms or have Covid again. I’ve had so many recurrences of symptoms but this feels worse and how I felt when I was infected in early March. Every symptom is the same: sore throat, ear pain, runny nose, congestion, headache, joint and muscle pain. One of the worst was the feeling of burning on the inside which I can’t explain in a way that makes any sense but I’d never felt this before Covid. My temperature is only slightly elevated and my skin feels cool. One issue that existed before Covid is that I don’t sweat. I’ve told every Dr I’ve ever met with about this and none listen or take it seriously. It means I’m always hot but with Covid this is unreal. I feel like I’m on fire on the inside of my body and head. Within a few days I’ll usually have chest pain and shortness of breath. It’s been 10 months of this and I’ve become so depressed I don’t know what to do anymore.

"I have a theory about my headaches, waiting to see a pulmonologist to see if I'm correct.  I have had a headache everyday, all day since November 12th.  It comes and goes and sometimes it's so intense I can't move.  I had a CT scan done and it was normal.  When I talked to my doc about the scan, she suggested I had sleep apnea, which I do but I also had it pre-Covid and never had this issue.  But that conversation got me to thinking, maybe it is low oxygen.  I didn't realize I had pneumonia when I had Covid.  Then I remembered, I also had asthma prior to Covid but only needed an inhaler for coughing fits during season changes.  I'm fact when I was diagnosed with asthma they had to do what's called a methacholine challenge because everyone was sure I had asthma but all the other test came back normal.  They have you breath in 5 different doses of methacholine and test your oxygen and breathing between each.  I thought the first test was the worst, it was the 5th.  So obviously I have no idea when my oxygen levels are getting low unless I'm coughing.Because of remembering this, yesterday when I had a raging headache, I grabbed the pulse ox reader - sure enough oxygen was down.  But here's the kicker, it didn't start down it gradually went down over a 2 minute time span and I was breathing normal - actually think I was breathing deeper.  So I'm going to schedule an appointment with a pulmonologist to see if I can get asthma maintenance medication to see if that will help. I don't know if anyone has had similar experiences and tried this.  If you have, please let me know if it worked.  I'm a teacher and go back teaching face to face Wednesday. I'm not sure how effective I'm going to be with the brain fog and headache.  I will update the group when I have answers.

"Hey everyoneso I have been dealing with daily symptoms that range from mild to moderate that I have considered to my range of new normal, from rashes to inner ear pain, tinnitus, unstable heart rate / blood pressure, muscle spasms, joint pain, bloodshot eyes, beyond congested, inability to think, headaches, back/neck pain, the whole soupI have been trying different things, now that I am 6 months since I contracted the virus, including warm/hot baths to try and slowly and gradually elevate my heart rate naturally without too much exercise and push the envelope to what I can handle in the hopes of getting better and 'pushing the illness out / healing the damage'.  Since we have very little to go on, I figure a little experiment in the name of healing might not hurt.  It might, but it might not. I am so frustrated because I spent the last 10 years a professional dancer, very used to elevated heart rates, and used to use hot and cold saunas/tubs as a method to work out my heart and circulation frequently.Today I had an attack that was as bad as when I had the virus.  I had just come out of a pretty hot bath, which I've been doing every second day or so as an exercise for my heart, and without any major trouble as of recently, which I have been happy about and I find it to be helpful sometimes.Today though, after being in the hot water, I went lightheaded, unable to stand, hands and feet went completely white and numb/tingly, veins bulging inward, felt Freezing, body started shaking, hard to take a breath, and crying uncontrollably, uncontrolled panic, thought I was dying.  I started noticing myself feeling uneasy in the water before the full episode and a voice telling me to 'trust my body' which is what prompted me to get the water temperature down and get out as quickly as possible, and continue taking deep breaths even though I felt like I couldn't.  I could feel my lungs filling up with phlegm that I couldn't cough up, and my sinuses clogging completely.How is this still happening?  What is going on in our bodies that causes this? Obviously we don't know the answer.  It feels like my body going into shock.  Felt almost exactly like I had the virus all over again. Before covid, heat used to cause elevated heart rate and even dizziness which is normal, but now it sometimes causes what feels like a state of shock, and heart palpitations, no matter how much time has passed, it seems.It's very disappointing to feel like I have relapsed like this.  I have a major headache right now and these.. bizarre muscle contractions in my pelvic region which started in a very specific area last month.  I took an apple cider vinegar pill and going to just chill out for the rest of the day.I want to be able to trust my body again.  I miss the days when it knew what it was doing.  I want to believe I can get better, I want to be able to help speed up that process.  Making a mistake in that journey seems life threatening though, and that scares me.  I felt like I was having one of the best days since contracting the virus this morning.  Now it's one of the worst. I need some predictability, some sense of routine.  If I knew I was going to have an episode every day at 5pm, that would feel so much better; having some idea, some sense of rhythm, some type of schedule, knowing when I would get sick or what it might feel like this time.  It's the not knowing, the sense of dread and doom, and panic and despair every time something flares up.  That is what is eating me up these days.  What is going to happen this time?  How bad is it going to get?  How much time do I have left?  What will they find out about me when I finally find a doctor who will take me seriously and do an MRI on my entire body and actually take a look?It's frustrating because even after what happened today, once it finally started to subside, shaking and lightheaded without much train of thought color coming back into my hands, dragging myself from off the floor, I refused to go to the hospital knowing they would just take an Xray of my heart and lungs again, tell me looks normal again, and give me anxiety meds for my 'panic disorder' again..  It's like... fuck off I'll handle it.Thank you to this group for existing.COVID just sucks. That is all.

"Happy New Year folks!I would like to reach out to group members one last time in case anyone else would like to participate in the study.I am a researcher at Sheffield Hallam University where myself and my colleagues are conducting a global online survey exploring the relationship between COVID-19 symptoms and pre-covid physical activity. We hope that insight from this work will add to what is known about the recovery of people who are suffering from COVID-19. To reassure you, we are NOT promoting physical activity as a route for recovery for people with Long-Covid. We would simply like to help determine who might be at risk of developing Long-Covid and whether pre-Covid fitness plays a role in this.
